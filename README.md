# Orbital_Learning


Use the codes in this repository to simulate Orbital Learning platform.

Steps:
1) Dowload the PTB-XL ECG dataset. Divide and create subsets of data representing various client datasets.
2) Use OL_experiments/OL_experiments.py to adjust/connect data generated by clients and simulate scenarios such as varied melioration rate or tampering.
3) Create a docker container using OL_experiments. Run it with volume connected to the folder containing your client datasets.
4) Run OL_experiments/main.py
5) Run OL_main.py
Alter Orbital_system.py and Orbital_plane.py to alter thresholds or number of meliorations.
